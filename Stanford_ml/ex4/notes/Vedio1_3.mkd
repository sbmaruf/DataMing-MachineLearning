##Notes
---
* Vedio 1
    * Talked about the cost function
* Vedio 2
    * Talked about the Back Propagation that to optimize the cost function that talked in Vedio 1
    * Back Propagation algorithm, I think, is a algorithm that to calculate the cost function, there are many steps that you must to follow to calculate the cost.
